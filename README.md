Various tools for DJ/Music software optimization and use of Serato on Steam Deck

These are various tools to use the Steam Deck with DJ software. 

Prerequisites:

You will need the following tools:

-Windows (sorry SteamOS fans, this is for users on Windows, not for DJ software on Proton)

-Steamdeck Windows Usermode Driver (for joystick mapping)

-Debloat Script above (if not using a Windows Lite install)

-AMD APU Tuning Utility (V2.0.5.8, currrent XUTU beta does not work for enough users that you should just go for what we know works. You won't get anything extra that is necessary for this setup by using the new version anyway.)

SWICD Key Map: for Serato DJ navigation/track load/browse use. 

***after installing SWICD, drop the folder above in your documents folder. We could also go with Windows Steam Deck Tools as a driver, but the key rempapping capabilities are not as comprehensive as in SWICD, and not suitable for use as a Serato Key Map navigation assistant.

-D-pad is up/down (fast) and switch between crates/browser (left/right)
-Y and A are single click (fine) up/down
-X/A are load to left/right decks
-3 line button loads selected track to prep crate
-2 square button by the D-pad is enter key (important if using with a Serato beta)
-R1 is the space bar to enter into browse view. Please note that, if within browser view, this function does not work and the user needs to toggle into full view first.
